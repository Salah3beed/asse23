## Aerospace Structures Course Project
- A stiffened panel is to be analysed regarding its structural strength and stability by means of an existing FE model. The panel is a skin segment of an aircraft wing between two spars and two ribs, which is stiffened by T-shaped stringers, as illustrated in Figure 1.
- All detailed dimensions, properties and boundary conditions can be obtained from within the FE model.
- Three representative load cases are considered. The internal section loads applied on the model boundaries are modelled as a combination of a longitudinal, transverse and shear load fraction, as seen in Figure 2. These fractions are scaled in each load case.
